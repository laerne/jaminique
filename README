How to run
==========

Windows
-------

* Go to http://www.python.org, and install python 3.4.x, *not* python 3.5.y.  Have files with extension .py launched with python, it will make things easier.
* Now go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/files and download the latest pygi-aio-3 setup executable.
* Run the setup executable and install PyGobject.  In the list of gnome packages to install, make sure to install GTK, or you won't be able to run the graphic interface.
* Launch CLI.py in the repository folder.

If you added the python executable to your PATH environment variable, you can also launch the programe with the terminal.

    U:\some\dir> cd path\to\jaminique
    U:\path\to\jaminique> python CLI.py

GNU/Linux
---------

Install python3, as well as pygobject and gtk3.
For Ubuntu users these are the packages `python3`, `python3-gi` and `libgtk-3-0`.

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-gi libgtk-3-0

For fedora users, these are the packages `python3`, `pygobject3` and `gtk3`

    $ sudo dnf install python3 pygobject3 gtk3

Launch `CLI.py` with `python3`.
If you're using the terminal, go to the project directory and launch with

    $ cd path/to/jaminique
    $ python3 CLI.py

Terminal options
================

Run the program in a terminal with the option `--help` to see all options.

Name list file format
=====================

You can create your own name list file format by simply creating a file holding one name per line.
The file should be saved using UTF-8 encoding, using UNIX end-of-line delimiters ("\n", not mac's "\r" or window's "\r\n").
Empty lines are ignored.

You can alternatively create a name list file using the name generator, by adding name entries, editing them and saving the list in a file.

All character are treated equivalently, including withespaces, with the few exceptions below.  None of these character can be escaped so far.
* '#' : Mark the beginning of a comment, until the end of the line.  Character from '#' to the end of the line are ignored.  Beware that spaces before '#' are significant.
* ':' : Used to specify a weight to a word.  After entering a name, you can append ':' and a numeric value to change the weight of the word.  Using ':' for any other purpose will make the program fail.
* '^' : Used by the generator engine to specify the beginning of the word.  Using this character in you name list will cause trouble.
* '$' : Used by the generator engine to specify the end of the word.  Using this character in you name list will cause trouble.
